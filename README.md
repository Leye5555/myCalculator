# myCalculator
Pure JavaScript simple calculator for basic arithmetic operations
In a bid to build a project that utilizes only basic javascript concepts in a beginner friendly manner, this calculator was built. 
Some of the most common concepts like loops, conditionals, basic DOM manipulation etc. were implemented.
Although slightly long and with little to no optimization or refactoring, it is such that one can easily read through the code and implement the logic there in.
The calculator can only perform basic arithmetic operations for now. Later more complex operations will be implemented.
In addition, the operations work only up till the fourth operator. e.g 22 + 33 + 878 + 8778 + 877 , has the plus operator occuring four times.
This as earlier pointed out is the calculators current limit.
Other operations like -, x, / all work according to BODMAS
Note that the use of special symbols like parenthesis "()" to seperate the operands or numbers, will result in NAN or error.
